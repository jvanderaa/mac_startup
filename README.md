# mac_startup

Start up to get a Mac up and running

## Components

Will leverage a couple of components to get up and running:

- **Make** to install the initial install of HomeBrew, Python3, and Ansible
- **Ansible** to install packages via Home Brew

### Note

The `make` process is untested right now. The Ansible portion is what I use as my daily updating.
